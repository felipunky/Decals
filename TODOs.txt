TODOs:
	-Parallax Occlusion Mapping
	-Refactor the decal upload
	-Play with the smoothstep for the Decal's SDF
	-Optimize it for the web
	-Pass shader string to include layout:
		-We need this to be able to use RenderDoc to debug shaders.
	-Add shadows look into CSM or simple Shadow Mapping
	-Fix weird ram leaks
	-Add file uploading from drag and drop
	-Add touch events
	-Add noise so that we can blend with the background more naturally, see:
		-https://superhivemarket.com/products/quick-decals
	-Get the texture sampling/wrapping methods of the Shader class to be static
	-Add the possibility for the user to choose the texture wrapping/sampling parameters
	-Fix texture sampling parameter errors.
	-Fix floating point texture sampling issues on mobile.
	-Fix filtering of JFA pass textures.
	-Fix issues for download of the Albedo with Decals when the state changes.

DONEs:
	-Implement JFA for proper alpha cutting
	-Add a fallback so that we don't need to compute the JFA when we don't want alpha to be taken into account.
	-Fixed depth frame buffer recreation, this caused a weird bug that the decal appeared on the back while it should've been culled.
	-Fixed the depthBias 
	-Added a drop down to debug textures it now supports:
		-Model view
		-Texture space view
		-JFA->SDF result
	-Get the newly implemented JFA to compile on WASM
	-Added collapsable params for ImGui
	-Fixed file uploading of Decals
	-Added regeneration of the texture space frame buffer
	-Fix broken decal, to trigger:
		-Upload a decal, change model
		-This is probably due to not recreating the TextureSpaceFramebuffer when changing.
	-Fix broken download of Decal on WASM:
		-To trigger, change model through the GUI
	-Added visualization of the SDF Box for the decals
	-Add proper scale params for the JFA input/decal texture
	-Added collapsable ImGui params depending on the state of the GUI
